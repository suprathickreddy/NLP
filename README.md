# NLP Sentiment Analysis on iPhone Reviews

## Overview
This project focuses on **Sentiment Analysis** of iPhone reviews using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. It classifies customer feedback as positive, neutral, or negative to gain insights into public sentiment. The analysis employs text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning models to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
- **Data Visualization:** Word clouds, sentiment distribution charts, and feature importance plots.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
- **Modeling Techniques:** TF-IDF vectorization, supervised learning algorithms

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NLP_Sentiment_Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd NLP_Sentiment_Analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the analysis.

## Results & Insights
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **XX%** (Replace with actual value).
- Positive reviews focused on performance, battery life, and camera quality.
- Negative reviews highlighted issues like overheating, software glitches, and pricing concerns.

## Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers) for enhanced accuracy.
- Expand dataset to improve generalizability.
- Develop a real-time sentiment analysis dashboard.
