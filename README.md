**NLP - Sentiment Analysis on iphone Reviews**


**Introduction:**
Within this notebook, we undertake an exploration of sentiment analysis employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies on a dataset containing reviews of iPhones. The dataset encompasses three pivotal columns: ratings, comments, and summaries. By harnessing the capabilities of NLP and implementing the Naive Bayes classifier, we have two main objectives.

**OBJECTIVES:**

1. Discern the sentiments articulated within these reviews.

2. Investigate whether comments serve as a superior indicator for sentiment classification compared to reviews.
